A simple image color reduction program which runs from command console.

Takes in three parameters: <input image file name>, <output image file name>, <color reduction divider>.
For example: ./ColorReduction lena.jpg lenaReduced.jpg 10 
The higher divider, the less colors will be present on the output image.
